# Flutterwave Payment Integration Fix

## Issue Identified
The "Invalid authorization key" error was occurring because:

1. **Wrong API Key Format**: The original keys in the environment didn't follow Flutterwave's standard format
2. **SDK Compatibility**: Using the Node.js SDK with potentially incompatible key formats
3. **API Version Mismatch**: Keys were labeled as "V4" but using V3 API endpoints

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Direct API Implementation
- Replaced the `flutterwave-node-v3` SDK with direct API calls
- Using proper authorization headers: `Bearer ${SECRET_KEY}`
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging

### 2. Improved Parameter Handling
- Added `order_id` parameter as required by the API
- Improved client IP detection with multiple fallbacks
- Added proper device fingerprinting
- Included redirect URL for payment completion

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Updated to use proper test keys for development
- Added app URL configuration for redirects
- Removed unused SDK dependency

## API Key Requirements

Your Flutterwave keys should follow this format:
- **Public Key**: `FLWPUBK_TEST-xxxxx-X` (test) or `FLWPUBK-xxxxx-X` (live)
- **Secret Key**: `FLWSECK_TEST-xxxxx-X` (test) or `FLWSECK-xxxxx-X` (live)

## Next Steps

### For Testing (Current Setup)
The app is now configured with test keys. This will allow you to test the integration flow.

### For Production
1. Get proper live API keys from your Flutterwave dashboard
2. Replace the test keys in `.env`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FLW_PUBLIC_KEY=FLWPUBK-your-live-public-key-X
   FLW_SECRET_KEY=FLWSECK-your-live-secret-key-X
   ```
3. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to your production domain

## Testing the Integration

The payment flow now:
1. Validates Uganda phone number format (256XXXXXXXXX)
2. Detects network (MTN/Airtel) automatically
3. Makes direct API call to Flutterwave
4. Provides proper error messages
5. Redirects to success page on completion

## Error Handling Improvements
- Better validation of required fields
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Key Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/flutterwave/route.ts` - Main payment API
- `/.env` - Environment configuration
- `/package.json` - Removed unused dependency
